## IBM 1130 Punch Card Format

### Card Structure
- **80 columns** - Standard IBM punch card width
- **12 rows** - Row 12, 11, 0-9 (Hollerith encoding)
- **Columns 1-72** - Data area (stored in binary format)
- **Columns 73-80** - Sequence numbers (not stored)

### File Format
- **Binary Format**: 108 bytes per card
- **Calculation**: 72 columns x 12 rows = 864 bits = 108 bytes
- **Deck File**: Concatenated 108-byte card records

```
Card 1: [108 bytes]
Card 2: [108 bytes]
Card 3: [108 bytes]
...
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation

**Note**: Project is in planning phase. Implementation not started.

Once implemented, installation will be:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wrightmikea/deck-editor.git
cd deck-editor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Open browser to http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Usage

### Creating a New Deck

1. Click "New Deck" button
2. Start with one blank card
3. Type text (up to 80 characters) to punch the card
4. Click "Add Card" to add more cards
5. Navigate between cards using Previous/Next buttons

### Loading a Deck

1. Click "Load" button
2. Select a `.deck` file (IBM 1130 108-byte format)
3. Deck loads and displays first card
4. Navigate through cards to view/edit

### Editing Cards

1. Select a card using navigation controls
2. Type in the text input field (max 80 characters)
3. Text is automatically converted to uppercase
4. See Hollerith punch patterns update in real-time
5. Click "Clear Card" to reset current card

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The deck editor supports keyboard shortcuts for efficient card navigation, similar to an authentic keypunch machine:

- **Enter** - Advance to next card (or add new card if at end of deck)
- **Tab** - Advance to next card (or add new card if at end of deck)
- **Shift+Tab** - Navigate to previous card

These shortcuts work when the text input field is focused, enabling rapid card entry without reaching for the mouse.

### Saving a Deck

1. Click "Save" button
2. Browser downloads file: `deck-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.deck`
3. File is in IBM 1130 108-byte format
4. Can be loaded back into deck editor or used with IBM 1130 simulator

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### TDD Workflow

**Red Phase**:
```javascript
// Write failing test
test('should convert character A to Hollerith code', () => {
  const code = HollerithCode.fromChar('A');
  expect(code.asArray()[12]).toBe(true); // Row 12
  expect(code.asArray()[1]).toBe(true);  // Row 1
});
```

**Green Phase**:
```javascript
// Implement minimal code to pass
static fromChar(char) {
  const rows = new Array(12).fill(false);
  if (char === 'A') {
    rows[12] = true;
    rows[1] = true;
  }
  return new HollerithCode(rows);
}
```

**Refactor Phase**:
```javascript
// Improve implementation
static fromChar(char) {
  const encoding = HOLLERITH_TABLE[char.toUpperCase()];
  return this.createFromEncoding(encoding);
}
```

See [docs/process.md](./docs/process.md) for complete TDD guide.
