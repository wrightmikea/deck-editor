## Known Issues

### Blockers
*None*

### Risks
*See plan.md for risk mitigation strategies*

1. **Browser File API compatibility** (Probability: Low, Impact: High)
   - Mitigation: Feature detection, graceful degradation

2. **Binary format errors** (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, reference file validation

3. **Performance with large decks** (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - Mitigation: Lazy loading, virtualization if needed

4. **Playwright MCP integration issues** (Probability: Low, Impact: Low)
   - Mitigation: Fallback to manual E2E testing

1. **Initialize Project** (30 min)
   ```bash
   cd wrightmikea/deck-editor
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Core Dependencies** (15 min)
   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom
   npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
   npm install --save-dev babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-react
   ```

3. **Create Basic Structure** (30 min)

   - Create `babel.config.js`
   - Create `src/index.js` (entry point)
   - Create `public/index.html`

4. **Verify Setup** (15 min)
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Should see React app running
   ```

5. **Install Testing Tools** (15 min)
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react
   ```

6. **Verify Testing** (15 min)
   - Create sample test
   - Run `npm test`
   - Ensure tests execute

**Total Estimated Time**: 2 hours

## Notes

### Design Decisions
- **No TypeScript**: Per requirements, using vanilla JavaScript
- **No Rust/Yew**: Using React instead (like punch-card app)
- **Binary Format**: IBM 1130 108-byte format (not 80-byte EBCDIC)
- **TDD Approach**: Red/Green/Refactor cycle for all features
- **MCP/Playwright**: For E2E testing and UI verification

### Lessons Learned
*To be updated as development progresses*

### Questions/Concerns
*None at this time*
